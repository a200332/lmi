{{#HasTerm}}
    <p>
    The term rider provides the option to purchase monthly
    term insurance on the life of the insured. The term rider
    selected face amount supplements the selected face amount
    of the contract. If the term rider is attached, the policy
    to which it is attached may have a lower annual cutoff premium
    and, as a result, the lower overall sales loads paid may be
    lower than a contract having the same total face amount,
    but with no term rider.
    {{#NoLapse}}
      Also, the lapse protection feature of the contract's
      {{NoLapseProvisionName}}
      does not apply to the term rider's selected face amount.
    {{/NoLapse}}
    </p>

    An additional charge is associated with this rider. Please refer
    to your contract for specific provisions and a detailed schedule
    of charges.
